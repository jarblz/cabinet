    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Retention is extremely expensive.</li>
      <li>Workforce feels undervalued at work.</li>
      <li>Companies cannot retain new-age talent.</li>

    <h3>Who is unbo<span style="color:#4774B3;">X</span>t</h3>
    <p>
        unbo<span style="color:#4774B3;">X</span>t has a simple vision, “to enrich lives by aligning, passions, interests,
      desires and needs.” Our slogan is Trust Transparency. Trust is possibly the
      most intimate and profound word in the English language. Transparency is
      possibly the most obscure. Trust takes time, and can only be built and
      maintained if all parties involved are transparent with one another. We
      believe that by building trust through transparency we can help everyone
      find a job they have passion in. But first, we will ensure everyone works
      within a team and company they enjoy. We believe this is possible and
      strive to prove it!

        Ahh and I almost forgot...we are going to destroy this idea of work / life
      balance. It’s highly implausible and illogical. Not to mention, has a deathly
      undertone. Imagine everytime you walk into work, you clock in by pressing
      pause on your life, before resuming life when you walk out. This has
      become the professional norm. It is no wonder people continue to believe
      the graveyard is the wealthiest place on earth.
      Now...more about us. After this, it’s all about you. Pinky promise. Our
      internal company values, are as follows:
    </p>
    <h4>Trust Transparency</h4>
    <p>
      Simple, tell and be the truth. Always be honest with the customer, with your team and
      most importantly, yourself.
    </p>

    <h4>Customer Obsession</h4>
    <p>
      Always be a leader. Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. The Leader
      works vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders are aware of
      competitors, they obsess over customers.
    </p>
    <h4>Curiosity</h4>
    <p>
      Always ask questions. Be confident in what you know, but seek to understand what you
      do not.
    </p>
    <h4>Stay in Lane</h4>
    <p>
      Being first, is not the same as being right. Being right, is being effective. “Right” is being
      true to yourself and remaining true to the company’s values and vision.
    </p>
    <h4>Drive Results</h4>
    <p>Forget intent, results are what matter. Do not settle for good enough.</p>
    <h4>Be Open</h4>
    <p>
      Be open and respectful to new experiences, ideas, people and cultures. Find comfort in
      being uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <h4>Try New Things</h4>
    <p>
      Be right! Strive to trust your instincts and both voices on your shoulders. Leaders are
      okay being wrong or misunderstood for long periods of time. Remember, overnight
      success takes 5-7 years.
    </p>

      candidates alike to authenticate and tell their personal tales.
